## Notice that the REST /lightpush requests normally assume that the node
## is acting as a lightpush-client that will trigger the service provider node
## to relay the message.
## In this module, we allow that a lightpush service node (full node) can be
## triggered directly through the  REST /lightpush endpoint.
## The typical use case for that is when using `nwaku-compose`,
## which spawn a full service Waku node
## that could be used also as a lightpush client, helping testing and development.
